## _Note: Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to experiment with or pilot this automation. These products are new to me, and I’m enthusiastic about continuing to explore and work with them._

Here’s a detailed **step-by-step project plan timeline** to guide your implementation from start to finish. This timeline assumes a **6-week schedule**, but it can be adjusted based on team size, complexity, and available resources.

## 📅 6-Week Project Plan Timeline: UiPath → CDP → dbt → JSON → Web

| **Week** | **Phase** | **Goals** | **Key Deliverables** |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| **Week 1** | 🔍 Requirements Gathering & Planning | Define scope, tools, and data sources | Project charter, tool selection matrix, data inventory |
| **Week 2** | 🏗️ Environment Setup | Prepare infrastructure and access | Installed tools, configured environments, access credentials |
| **Week 3** | 🔄 Automation & Data Ingestion | Build UiPath workflows and ingest data into CDP | UiPath scripts, test data loads, ingestion logs |
| **Week 4** | 🧪 Data Transformation with dbt | Clean and structure data for JSON output | dbt models, transformation logic, test results |
| **Week 5** | 📤 Export & Web Integration | Convert data to JSON and integrate with website | JSON files, CMS/API integration, frontend test pages |
| **Week 6** | 🚀 Deployment & Monitoring | Launch pipeline and set up monitoring | Scheduled jobs, dashboards, documentation, handoff |
